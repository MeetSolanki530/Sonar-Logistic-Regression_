# Sonar Object Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project explores the fascinating world beneath the waves using machine learning. It uses Logistic Regression to classify underwater objects as either 'Rocks' or 'Mines' based on sonar signals. The accuracy achieved is approximately 80.95%, showcasing the potential of data science in understanding underwater environments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Sonar" dataset, containing sonar signals reflected off underwater objects. It consists of numerical features representing signal frequencies and patterns, with corresponding labels 'R' (Rock) and 'M' (Mine). The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks.

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook `sonar_logistic_regression.ipynb` to explore the code and results.
- Customize the input data in the notebook to make predictions on new underwater objects.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80.95% in classifying underwater objects. Visualizations of the confusion matrix and ROC curve are included in the notebook to assess the model's performance.
